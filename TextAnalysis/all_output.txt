Transcript: hello world in storage and I'm excited to announce that school of AI is launching a research lab thanks to Google Cloud we're going to offer 10 Wizards 1000 US dollars in Cloud credits to pursue some exciting research directions they'll be our fall 2018 fellows each of them will receive personalized mentorship from one of our experience advisors to help them along their Journey we like to grow the amateur research community that means Wizards from around the world who aren't necessarily a part of Academia or industry we believe that by enabling them to do research with a complete pipeline of resources from funding to mentorship to helping them submit their work to relevant Outlets the entire AI Community will benefit so here's the plan we've got some research directions that we think are particularly exciting including

Transcript: work for deep reinforcement learning research called slm lab its design was Guided by four principles modularity Simplicity analytical Clarity and crucially reproducibility we got several Baseline reinforcement learning algorithms implemented and more to come as l m lab is an easy way to get started with deep reinforcement learning research you can just build on top of an existing algorithm and Benchmark the results all the algorithms relevant environments and testing tools are included in a single repository we have both a static and dynamic version of our paper the static version is a PDF like all papers are but the dynamic version is a Jupiter notebook we posted it on Google collab which means that anyone who read the paper can also view the results and a demo of slm lab by running code themselves in their brows
